********************LINKED STRUCTURES************************
A linked structure is a concrete data type that implements many types 
of collections, including lists.

As the name implies, a linked structure consists of items that are 
linked to other items. The two that we'll go over are the Singly/Doubly
Linked structures

- Head Link - the first item of a linked structure
- Tail Link - an external link in a doubly linked structure to access the last item directly
- Empty Link - the absence of a link, indicated by the slash in the diagram

- The last item in either structure has no link to a next item

- Node - The basic unit of representation in a linked structure
    - comprised of atwo items
        - A Data Item
        - A link to the next node in the structure

In python we set up nodes and linked structures by using references to object
