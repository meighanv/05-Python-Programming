# **************** ALGORITHMS **********************
# Algorithm - Describes a computational process that halts with a solution
#             to a problem.

#             There are many criteria for assessing the quality of an algorithm.
#             The most essential criterion is correctness, it actually solves 
#             the problem it's meant to solve. Readabilitity and ease of 
#             maintenance are also important qualities. Run-time performance 
#             is one of the most important qualities. 

# Benchmarking - measure the time cost of an algorithm to obtain an actual run time

# Counting - Another way to measure time complexity (efficiency) of an algorithm 
#             with different problem sizes. Kee in mind you are counting the instructions
#             in the high-level code in which the algorithm is written, not instructions 
#             in the executable machine language code
