Python Libraries Group Project
​
    The point of this project is to get used to using libraries, gain a deep understanding of the os and sys 
    libraries, collaborating with git, and getting used to referencing documentation. One of Python's 
    strengths is its many standard libraries that come built into the language. While diving deeper 
    into Python you will realize that there are a plethora of libraries, standard or third party, that 
    you will eventually have to start using. 
​
Read through os and sys Python Libraries located below:
​
    https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html 
    https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html 
​
​
Make an app that takes in user input to get definitions and an example of methods.
Can be GUI or command line. Definitions and examples can either be displayed
on the command line or written to a file for the user to look at later, or both. 
​
Split into groups of 4.
​
Each team member will upload different parts to github by creating a repository and using branching.
Before you start splitting up work, sit together and decide how you're going to 
build out your app. Use pseudocode to come up with function names and classes.
You can split up work by assigning each member to different classes or different 
functionality. If you realize you need more functions or more classes then modify 
your design document. 
​
Commenting code is necessary, your team members, and eventually the rest of the class
will need to know how your code works and why you decided to design your program the 
way you did.
​
Utilize everything we have learned so far
​
If you finish early then add extra functionality or add another library of your choice. 
Remember to branch off of master tokeep a working version of your project. Merge branches 
if you are happy with your extra functionality.
​
Recommended extra libraries to look into:
    Pyxel - pixel games
    Pygame - 2d games
    csv - working with csv files
    NumPy - working with arrays of data
    Pandas - data analysis library
    Matplotlib - plotting, graphs
    Twisted - networking
​
You will have until 12:30 PM Tuesday 11/26/2019 to complete this. We will demonstrate our projects
that afternoon.
