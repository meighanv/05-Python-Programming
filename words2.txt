3. File Encryption and Decryption
Write a program that uses a dictionary to assign "codes" to each letter of the alphabet. For
example:
codes = { 'A' : '%', 'a' : '9', 'B' : '@', 'b' : '#', etc...}
Using this example, the letter A would be assigned the symbol %, the letter a would be
assigned the number 9, the letter B would be assigned the symbol @, and so forth.
The program should open a specified text file, read its contents, and then use the dictionary to 
write an encrypted version of the fileâ€™s contents to a second file. Each character in
the second file should contain the code for the corresponding character in the first file.
